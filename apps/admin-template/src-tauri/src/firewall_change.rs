//! Issue #219 stage 2 (ADR-0021, E2): the pieces of the `firewall_rule_change`
//! command that do not need `AppState` - the pre-elevation placement check
//! (decision 8), what the helper's exit code means (decision 11) and the
//! response / audit shapes (decisions 11-13). The command itself (role gate,
//! target comparison, launch, audit, re-read) is in `lib.rs`.
//!
//! The placement rule is not restated here: [`judge_before_elevation`] calls
//! the helper crate's own `placement::check_placement` over the facts its
//! `win::collect_placement_facts` reads (the same function and tests as the
//! helper's own check after it started). Only the helper's lib is a
//! dependency - its bin and manifest stay out of this exe.
//!
//! Everything sent to the screen is a code; the screen builds the text
//! (conventions §13). Exit code 0 is reported as `done`, never as "reachable"
//! - whether other devices can connect is stage 1's reach check.
