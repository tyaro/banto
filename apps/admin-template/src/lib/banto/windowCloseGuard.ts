/**
 * Desktop window close vs. unsaved changes (issue #214). Closing the Tauri
 * window is an OS window event, not a router navigation, so the
 * unsaved-changes guard (`$lib/unsavedChanges.ts`, built on SvelteKit's
 * `beforeNavigate`) is not relied on for it. This listens to Tauri's
 * close-requested event and asks with the same `window.confirm` the rest of
 * the app uses.
 *
 * Kept in the provider layer (conventions §10): the caller only decides
 * WHEN to watch; the Tauri branch lives here.
 *
 * Blast radius: while a JS close-requested listener exists, Tauri stops the
 * native close and `onCloseRequested` closes the window itself with
 * `destroy()` (capability `core:window:allow-destroy`). The caller therefore
 * registers this only while something is unsaved (`hasUnsavedChanges()`), so
 * a clean app closes exactly as before and any failure here can only affect
 * a window that has unsaved edits.
