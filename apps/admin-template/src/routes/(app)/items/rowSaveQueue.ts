/**
 * Issue #284: per-row save serialization for inline edits and range pastes.
 *
 * Root cause being fixed: each save used to build the full editable value set
 * from a stale row snapshot (`edit.row`, taken when the edit started), so two
 * overlapping saves to the same row - e.g. paste into `name`, then paste into
 * `stock` before the first response lands - sent `{name: <old>, stock: new}`
 * and the later write reverted the earlier one.
 *
 * Fix: saves for one row id run strictly one after another (a Promise chain),
 * and the request body is composed at the moment of SENDING from the latest
 * confirmed row (the previous save's response) plus only this save's changed
 * columns. Different rows do not block each other.
 *
 * Failure semantics: a failed save rejects only its own caller; the chain
 * continues, and the failed values are never folded into the confirmed row, so
 * later saves are based on the last confirmed values. Results are produced in
 * send order (the chain guarantees it).
 *
 * The confirmed row for an id is dropped once its queue drains, so a later
 * edit falls back to the caller's current display row (which may have been
 * reloaded or edited elsewhere in the meantime).
