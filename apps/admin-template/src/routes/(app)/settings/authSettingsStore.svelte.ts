/**
 * Shared `AuthSettings` (M11 login-not-required mode) load state. Module
 * singleton (same pattern as `$lib/session.svelte.ts`), needed here because
 * the settings-split refactor (choiapp-feedback-2026-09 §3) has THREE
 * readers of the same loaded value in different components:
 * - `AccountSection.svelte`'s autologin card (read-only; also refreshes it
 *   via `load()` after enabling/disabling autologin).
 * - `ConnectivitySection.svelte`'s LAN-toggle gating (read-only:
 *   `value?.disabled`).
 * - `SecuritySection.svelte`, which owns the mutating controls
 *   (`disabledDraft`/`disabledRoleDraft`) and re-syncs its own drafts via its
 *   own `$effect` whenever `.value` changes here - including when
 *   AccountSection's autologin actions call `load()`.
 *
 * The INITIAL load (settings-routes step 2, Copilot review on PR #198) now
 * runs once in the persistent `settings/+layout.svelte` instead of inside
 * SecuritySection's own mount effect - a direct visit to
 * `/settings/account` or `/settings/connectivity` needs this value too
 * (autologin status / the LAN auth-disabled gate) and neither of those
 * sections' own routes used to run SecuritySection's effect. `error` mirrors
 * that same move: the layout's load effect writes here instead of a
 * SecuritySection-local `authError`, so the section can keep showing the
 * same error text without owning the fetch.
