/**
 * Shared `SystemInfo` (M-review 2026-08 §2.4) load state. Module singleton
 * (same "module singleton populated once, read from anywhere" pattern as
 * `#lib/session.svelte.ts`/`$lib/settings.svelte.ts`), needed here because
 * the settings-split refactor (choiapp-feedback-2026-09 §3) put its two
 * readers in different components:
 * - `ConnectivitySection.svelte`'s System Info card.
 * - `DataSection.svelte`'s `backupPostgresDialect` gate (spec M17: built-in
 *   backup/restore is SQLite-only).
 *
 * `isBackupsAvailable()`/`isSystemInfoAvailable()` share the exact same
 * "real backend, not the plain-browser demo" condition, so whenever
 * DataSection's backups card can render, ConnectivitySection's System Info
 * card is also present (admin-gated like DataSection, but unconditionally
 * rendered for any admin - see `+page.svelte`'s `showConnectivity`).
 *
 * The load effect itself (settings-routes step 2, Copilot review on PR
 * #198) lives in the persistent `settings/+layout.svelte`, not in
 * ConnectivitySection anymore - `DataSection`'s `backupPostgresDialect` gate
 * needs this value on a DIRECT visit to `/settings/data` too, which never
 * mounted ConnectivitySection to trigger its old effect. `error` is written
 * by that same layout effect so ConnectivitySection can keep showing the
 * same error text without owning the fetch.
