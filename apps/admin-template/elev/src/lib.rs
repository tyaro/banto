//! `admin-template-fw-elev.exe`: the UAC-elevated helper that adds and
//! removes the one Windows Firewall rule of Issue #219 stage 2
//! ([ADR-0021](../../../../docs/adr/0021-firewall-elevated-helper.md)).
//!
//! ```text
//! admin-template-fw-elev.exe firewall-allow | firewall-remove | firewall-status
//! ```
//!
//! The operation name is the only argument (decision 10): the identifier is
//! a build-time constant ([`IDENTIFIER`], decision 5), the program is the
//! main exe next to the helper ([`MAIN_EXE_FILE_NAME`], decision 8) and the
//! remote range is fixed to `LocalSubnet` (decision 4). Results are exit
//! codes only (decision 11): [`EXIT_OK`] 0, [`EXIT_FAILED`] 1,
//! [`EXIT_PRECONDITION`] 2, [`EXIT_ALREADY`] 3, [`EXIT_CONFLICT`] 4,
//! [`EXIT_POLICY`] 5, [`EXIT_USAGE`] 64. Callers always re-read the state
//! with stage 1's `firewall_rule_status` afterwards.
//!
//! Layout (decision 7): this lib holds the pure functions - arguments,
//! rule ownership ([`rules`]), the placement judgement ([`placement`],
//! shared with the main app's pre-elevation check), the PowerShell scripts
//! and their output ([`powershell`]) - and the procedure [`run`] over two
//! traits, tested with fakes on every OS (no test touches the real
//! firewall or ACLs). [`win`] (Windows only) collects the facts from the OS
//! and runs PowerShell. The bin (`main.rs`) only passes its arguments here.
