//! Pins the parts of `banto-server`'s API that derived apps depend on, from
//! OUTSIDE the crate (an integration test is compiled as a separate crate).
//!
//! A unit test inside `src/` still compiles if an item is narrowed from `pub`
//! back to `pub(crate)`; this file does not. Each function here is
//! compile-only - it is never called - so it pins visibility and signature,
//! not behaviour (behaviour is covered by the unit tests in `src/auth.rs`).
