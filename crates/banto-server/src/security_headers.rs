//! Baseline security response headers (`docs/history/improvements.md` §2.4): CSP,
//! `nosniff`, frame-deny, `Referrer-Policy`. Applied uniformly to every
//! response - static UI assets and `/api/*` (JSON *and* SSE) alike - via a
//! single outermost layer, so a new route can never forget to opt in.
//!
//! Independent of [`crate::csrf::require_banto_client_header`] (rejects
//! requests missing a header) and [`crate::response::ApiError`] (shapes
//! error bodies): this layer only *appends* response headers after the
//! inner router has already produced a response, so it never touches
//! status/body and cannot conflict with either.
//!
//! # Widening `connect-src` (opt-in, optionally per request)
//!
//! [`with_security_headers`] always sends the strict
//! [`CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY`]. An app whose *own* desktop shell navigates a
//! Tauri webview to this HTTP UI (e.g. banto-industrial's banto-hub shell
//! opening `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/status`) runs that page under the
//! *response* CSP, not the Tauri window CSP, so the page's Tauri IPC fetches
//! (`http://ipc.localhost/...`) are blocked by `connect-src 'self'` (Tauri
//! then falls back to `postMessage`, but every load logs violations). For
//! that case [`SecurityHeaders`] + [`with_security_headers_using`] add
//! sources to `connect-src` *only*, either for every response or only for
//! requests a selector accepts (e.g. [`request_from_loopback_peer`]). Every
//! other directive and header is identical to the strict default.
//!
//! ## Security impact of adding [`TAURI_IPC_CONNECT_SRC`]
//!
//! What `connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost` grants a page that is *not*
//! inside Tauri (an ordinary browser that happens to receive the widened
//! policy):
//!
//! - `ipc:` is a Tauri custom scheme. Browsers have no handler for it, so a
//!   `fetch("ipc://...")` fails before any network I/O: inert.
//! - `http://ipc.localhost` resolves (WHATWG URL / RFC 6761 `.localhost`) to
//!   the *viewer's own* loopback. The scope is port 80 (http) **and** port 443
//!   (https): in CSP3 an `http:` source expression also matches `https:` URLs
//!   (scheme matching upgrade), and an omitted port matches the default port
//!   of the *request URL's* scheme, so `http://ipc.localhost` also allows
//!   `https://ipc.localhost` (:443). The only new reach is "an injected
//!   script could `fetch`/`EventSource` to whatever listens on port 80 or 443
//!   of the viewer's machine" (an actual connection still needs the local
//!   service to speak HTTP / TLS). It is not an off-host exfiltration
//!   channel, and CSP is defence in depth against an XSS that would already
//!   have to exist. Still non-zero (a local service on :80 or :443 could
//!   receive data), so the strict policy stays the default and the widening
//!   should be narrowed.
//!
//! Choosing *which* requests get it (the selector):
//!
//! - **Every response** (no selector): simplest, but LAN browsers get the
//!   widened policy too. Not recommended when the server listens on the LAN.
//! - **Loopback peer** ([`request_from_loopback_peer`], reads the
//!   `ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>` that [`crate::start`] /
//!   [`crate::BoundServer::serve`] always install): the peer address comes
//!   from the TCP connection, not from anything a remote page or link can
//!   set, so LAN browsers connecting *directly* keep the strict policy.
//!   Residual: a browser on the *same host* (also loopback) gets the
//!   widened policy - the `:80` / `:443` reach above is then that host's own
//!   loopback, i.e. the machine already running this server. But it cannot
//!   tell a same-host reverse proxy from the desktop shell (next point), so
//!   on its own it is only safe when no such proxy can be in front.
//! - **Caveat - same-host reverse proxy**: if a reverse proxy on the same
//!   host forwards LAN traffic to this server over loopback (e.g. a TLS
//!   terminator per ADR-0003 such as Caddy's `reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:<port>`),
//!   *every* request arrives from a loopback peer, so
//!   [`request_from_loopback_peer`] widens `connect-src` for LAN browsers
//!   too: an injected script in a LAN viewer's page could then reach whatever
//!   listens on port 80 or 443 of *that viewer's own machine*
//!   (`http://ipc.localhost`; `ipc:` stays inert). Forwarded headers
//!   (`X-Forwarded-For`, `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-Host`) are client-settable
//!   unless the proxy overwrites them, so they are not used.
//! - **Loopback peer *and* loopback authority** ([`request_is_loopback_local`],
//!   2026-10-06): additionally requires the request's authority (`Host`, or
//!   the URI authority = HTTP/2 `:authority`) to be a loopback IP literal or
//!   `localhost`. **This is the recommended selector for a desktop shell
//!   that navigates to its own HTTP UI.** The `Host` header is chosen by the
//!   client, so it must never be the *only* reason to widen; but ANDed with
//!   the loopback peer it can only *narrow* the peer check:
//!   - A browser sets `Host` from the URL it navigated to. A LAN viewer going
//!     through a same-host proxy that preserves `Host` (Caddy's default)
//!     presents the public name or LAN address (`hub.example.lan`,
//!     `192.168.1.10`) and gets the strict policy; the desktop shell
//!     navigates to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` and gets the widened one.
//!   - A remote page cannot make a victim's browser reach this server from a
//!     loopback peer (the peer check still applies), and a DNS-rebinding
//!     name is not a loopback literal / `localhost`.
//!   - A client that forges `Host` (curl etc.) only changes the CSP of the
//!     response *it* receives - it cannot choose the policy for anyone else.
//!   - Residual 1, the same as the loopback-peer selector: a browser on the
//!     same host opening `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` directly gets the widened
//!     policy (its `:80` / `:443` is this host's loopback).
//!   - Residual 2, **operators must not rewrite `Host` to the upstream
//!     address at the proxy**: a proxy that sends `Host: 127.0.0.1:<port>`
//!     upstream (Caddy `header_up Host {upstream_hostport}`; also **nginx's
//!     default** `proxy_set_header Host $proxy_host` when `proxy_pass` names
//!     `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` - set `proxy_set_header Host $host`) makes
//!     every proxied request look local again. In such a deployment keep
//!     `Host` preserved, leave the widening off, or have the proxy set its
//!     own `Content-Security-Policy`.
//!   - `X-Forwarded-Host` / `Forwarded: host=` are deliberately ignored: a
//!     proxy that does not overwrite them passes the client's value through,
//!     so trusting them could only *widen*.
//! - **Request headers / query / `Host` alone**: attacker-influenceable (a
//!   crafted link sets the query; `Host` follows the URL the victim opens), so
//!   a selector built on them *without* the loopback-peer check lets a remote
//!   party pick the weaker policy for a victim. Don't.
//!
//! The selector only ever chooses between the strict policy and the widened
//! one: it can never make a response weaker than "strict + the configured
//! extra `connect-src` sources", nor touch the other directives or headers.
