//! LAN reach check - "did another device actually reach this server?"
//! (Issue #219 stage 1, `docs/design/lan-reach-check-design.md`, PR-C1).
//!
//! The administrator's own screen issues a one-time token ([`ReachCheckState::issue`],
//! wired to an admin-only Tauri command by the app) and shows it as a QR code /
//! URL whose FRAGMENT carries the token. A phone on the LAN opens the URL, the
//! SPA's `/reach` page POSTs the token to `POST /api/reach-check`
//! ([`reach_check_router`]), and the store records that a request from that
//! peer reached this listener. The administrator's screen then reads
//! [`ReachCheckState::status`].
//!
//! ## The one extra unauthenticated route (design §3.1)
//!
//! `POST /api/reach-check` is reachable WITHOUT a session. It never issues
//! one: the response is `{ "result": "<code>" }` and nothing else (no token,
//! no bearer, no server details - design §3.10), it does not touch
//! [`crate::AuthState`], grants or `require_auth`, and a successful check
//! leaves every other `/api/*` route at `401`. It behaves the same whether
//! viewer-public / auth-disabled mode is on or off.
//!
//! ## What a token is (design §3.3 - §3.5)
//!
//! - a `uuid` v4 (122 bits of OS randomness, the session token's strength);
//! - valid for [`TOKEN_TTL`] (5 minutes) on the monotonic clock;
//! - used ONCE: a successful check consumes it;
//! - at most ONE at a time: issuing again revokes the previous one;
//! - bound to the listener generation it was issued under: the store, the
//!   router that received the request and the token must all agree
//!   ([`ReachCheckState::begin_generation`] drops everything otherwise);
//! - bound to the URL host it was issued for: the request's `Host` must name
//!   that host and the receiving listener's port (`hostMismatch` otherwise,
//!   and the token is not consumed);
//! - compared in constant time ([`constant_time_eq`]); expiry / generation /
//!   host are judged only AFTER the bytes matched.
//!
//! Used, expired, other-generation and malformed tokens all answer the same
//! `404 { "result": "unusable" }`.
//!
//! ## This PC itself (design §3.6)
//!
//! The peer comes ONLY from `ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>` (no `X-Forwarded-For`;
//! no peer -> `403 unusable`, fail closed). A loopback peer, or one of this
//! PC's own interface addresses (enumerated at issuance, not per request),
//! is "this PC itself" (judged after the Host and listener-port checks, so
//! it is only reported for the URL the token was issued for): the request is
//! answered `selfAccess`, remembered only
//! as "this PC accessed at <time>", and the token is NOT consumed - the
//! administrator may still scan it with a phone. Behind a same-host reverse
//! proxy every peer is the proxy, so everything is "this PC itself" (the
//! embedded server does not assume a proxy; documented, not coded - like
//! ADR-0017 §6).
//!
//! ## Memory, rate limit, logging (design §3.8, §3.9)
//!
//! Memory only, never persisted: the current token, the last issuance's
//! outcome (`pending` / `recorded` / `expired`, without the token), the
//! latest [`MAX_RECORDS`] reach records and the last self-access time.
//! Failed checks (`unusable` / `hostMismatch`) are counted per peer IP:
//! [`RATE_LIMIT_FAILURES`] within [`RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`] blocks that IP for
//! [`RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`] (`429 rateLimited` + `Retry-After`, without even
//! comparing), in a table of at most [`RATE_LIMIT_TABLE_CAP`] IPs (oldest
//! evicted). Successful checks are not counted.
//!
//! The token is never logged, audited, recorded or echoed; records are
//! identified by a non-secret per-issuance serial (`issueId`). Neither
//! issuance nor reach is audited (design D8; conventions §1 Issue #278: an
//! uncredentialed route must not amplify the audit log).
//!
//! ## CSRF
//!
//! [`reach_check_router`] carries the `X-Banto-Client` requirement
//! ([`crate::require_banto_client_header`]) ITSELF, so it holds wherever the
//! app merges it - also outside an app's own `/api` CSRF layer (the template
//! merges it next to `api_router`, whose layer only covers the routes
//! inside it). Merging it inside such a layer as well just checks twice.
