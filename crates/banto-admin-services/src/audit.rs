//! Audit trail service (spec M14, `docs/roadmap.md`): who did what, when,
//! over which transport, and whether it was allowed. Backed by the
//! `audit_log` table (migration `0005_audit_log.sql`), same service-layer
//! pattern as `admin_template_core::items::ItemsService` - testable in a
//! plain `cargo test`, no `tauri`/`axum` dependency.
//!
//! Moved from `admin-template-core::audit` to this crate in theme C PR-C1
//! (docs/template-scope.md §7 移行順 ①): the logic is domain-agnostic, so it
//! belongs in the shared crate rather than in code every adopter copies.
//!
//! **This service does not know about actors, RBAC, or HTTP** - it only
//! knows how to store/list/prune rows. Every REST handler and Tauri command
//! that mutates state (or gets rejected by an RBAC guard) is responsible for
//! building an [`AuditEntry`] itself and calling
//! [`AuditLogService::record`] - see `admin_template_core::rest`'s and
//! `src-tauri`'s `require_role`/`require_role_at_least` call sites for where
//! the actor (`Identity`) and the REST/Tauri "origin" are known.
//!
//! SECURITY: [`AuditEntry::detail`] is a JSON **summary** (spec: "値の全量は
//! 入れない") - changed field NAMES, a new role, a method+path, etc. Nothing
//! that calls into this module may ever put a password, password hash, or
//! bearer token into `detail`. There is no runtime guard against this (the
//! type is a free-form `serde_json::Value`) - it is enforced by review at
//! every call site instead.
//!
//! ## The spool: an audit write the database cannot take (ADR-0019)
//!
//! [`AuditLogService::record`] must not fail or block the operation it
//! audits, and before ADR-0019 an entry it could not write was only logged
//! (`eprintln`) and lost. An app can opt in to a **spool**
//! ([`AuditLogService::with_spool`], tyaro/banto-industrial#437): `record`
//! then
//!
//! 1. fixes a `pending_id` (UUIDv4) and the `ts` before writing, and INSERTs
//!    them with the row (`ON CONFLICT (pending_id) DO NOTHING`, the unique
//!    index of migration `0008_audit_log_pending_id.sql`);
//! 2. waits for the INSERT at most [`SpoolConfig::timeout`] (3 s by
//!    default). On an error, or no answer in time, it writes the entry to a
//!    file in the spool directory and returns. A timed-out INSERT is **not**
//!    cancelled - it runs on in a spawned task and may still complete;
//! 3. flushes the spool into `audit_log` later
//!    ([`AuditLogService::flush_spool`]: at startup when the app calls it,
//!    after a successful `record` when entries are waiting or the spool
//!    directory has not been read for [`SpoolConfig::flush_interval`], and
//!    from [`AuditLogService::spawn_spool_flusher`]'s periodic task, which
//!    reads the directory every interval even when this process spooled
//!    nothing - another process sharing the directory may have). The flush
//!    INSERTs with the same `pending_id` and `ts`, so an entry whose original
//!    INSERT completed late is not written twice, and several processes
//!    flushing one directory are safe too. Rows written by a flush carry
//!    `"spooled": true` in `detail` (merged into an object `detail`; any
//!    other `detail` is wrapped as `{"value": <detail>, "spooled": true}`).
//!
//! `ts` is the time of the `record` call, in the text the column DEFAULT
//! would have produced: SQLite `datetime('now')` (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`,
//! UTC); PostgreSQL `now()::text` (the UTC microsecond time is cast through
//! `timestamptz` to `text` by the INSERT, so it follows the session's
//! `TimeZone`/`DateStyle` exactly like the DEFAULT). A flushed row therefore
//! sorts and filters by when it happened, not when it was flushed - and a
//! retention prune ([`AuditLogService::prune`]) may delete it right after the
//! flush if it is already older than the retention period.
//!
//! **Without a spool nothing changes**: `record` awaits [`try_record`]
//! inline (no timeout, no `pending_id`, `ts` from the DEFAULT), so an app
//! that has not applied migration `0008` keeps working. [`try_record`]
//! never spools - its callers want the operation to fail when the audit
//! write does.
//!
//! ## Where the warning lines go
//!
//! By default every warning line this service logs (a `record` failure
//! without a spool, and all spool messages: spooled, flushed, dropped,
//! failed, quarantined, unreadable or unremovable file, flush failed) is
//! printed with `eprintln!` (ADR-0004). An app without a stderr - a Windows
//! service - routes them to its own log with
//! [`AuditLogService::with_log_sink`] ([`AuditLogSink`]); the sink gets the
//! same text `eprintln!` would print, without the trailing newline.
//!
//! [`try_record`]: AuditLogService::try_record
