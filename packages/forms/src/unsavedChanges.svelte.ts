/**
 * Unsaved-changes guard (spec §7, issue #214): warn before an in-app
 * navigation, a reload/tab close, or (via the host's own wiring) a desktop
 * window close would silently throw away an edit that has not been saved.
 *
 * Design:
 * - **Confirm, don't restore.** The page keeps its draft in memory only; the
 *   guard asks before leaving instead of persisting a draft to come back to.
 *   Restoring would need a storage location, an expiry rule for stale drafts
 *   and a multi-tab story - a confirm prompt needs none of those.
 * - **No SvelteKit / Tauri dependency.** This package has no dependencies
 *   (conventions §3/§4/§5), so the host injects `beforeNavigate` from
 *   `$app/navigation` (a structural subset is typed below). The same
 *   callback also covers reload / tab close: SvelteKit calls it with
 *   `type: 'leave'` from its own `beforeunload` listener, where cancelling
 *   makes the browser show its native (non-customisable) prompt.
 * - **One prompt per navigation, however many guards are on screen.** Every
 *   mounted guard registers in a module-level registry; the first guard
 *   callback SvelteKit invokes for a navigation checks the WHOLE registry
 *   and answers for all of them (SvelteKit hands every callback the same
 *   navigation object, which is what `handled` keys on). A page with two
 *   save-type sections therefore prompts once if either one is unsaved.
 * - **The decision is a pure table** (`decideLeave`) so every state
 *   combination is unit-tested without a router.
