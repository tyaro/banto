/**
 * `DraftCoordinator` (spec §7; shared-primitives-upstream-plan §3.5・§4.2・D3,
 * Issue #432): apply / discard / cancel for several forms with ONE prompt,
 * and keep unapplied input across a pane re-mount.
 *
 * The coordinator knows nothing about the dock (`@banto/forms` cannot import
 * `@banto/dock-svelte`, plan §2.1). The app connects them per transition
 * (plan §3.5 table):
 *
 * - dock / undock / move-docked (content re-mounts, input is KEPT):
 *   `capture([panelId])`, then let the change happen. When the re-mounted pane
 *   registers the same key, the captured state is `restore`d (rebind). No
 *   prompt. A pane built on `FormDraft` needs nothing - the draft outlives it.
 * - tab-switch / hide: keep the DOM (dock's `keepMounted`) or capture as above.
 *   No prompt.
 * - close (content is DISCARDED): `settle([panelId], ask)`; close only for
 *   `'clean'` / `'applied'` / `'discarded'`.
 *
 * Guarantees of `settle`:
 *
 * - `ask` is called at most once per call, with every dirty key.
 * - `'applied'` / `'discarded'` mean every target was clean WHEN settle
 *   resolved: after the awaits each source's `isDirty()` is checked again;
 *   input typed while an apply was awaited makes it `'dirty-again'` (the input
 *   is kept, never discarded).
 * - A failed / thrown / cancelled apply never discards input (`'failed'`).
 * - `'stale'`: the target changed while settle was awaiting - a source of a
 *   target key was unregistered or replaced (rebind), another `settle` of the
 *   same key started, or the coordinator was disposed. Nothing is reported as
 *   resolved. This uses the package-internal request owner, which runs the same
 *   contract table as admin-core's `createRequestOwner` (plan §4.1・D1).
 *
 * Every registration also joins `guardUnsavedChanges`' registry, so a router
 * leave and `hasUnsavedChanges()` (desktop window close) see the same drafts.
 * Double prompts are prevented by the existing "one prompt per navigation"
 * rule (every guard checks the whole registry once per navigation). The
 * registry is read only by mounted guards: a page that wants router leaves
 * covered mounts one, e.g. `guardUnsavedChanges({ isDirty: () => coordinator.pending, ... })`.
 *
 * Re-entrancy: own state is committed before any consumer callback (`ask`,
 * `apply`, `discard`, `capture`, `restore`) runs, and checked again after it
 * returns, so a callback that registers, disposes or settles again cannot be
 * overwritten or rolled back.
