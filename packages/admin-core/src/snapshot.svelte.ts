/**
 * `createSnapshotListResource` composable (spec §4.1, Issue #248): a sparse,
 * block-fetched list resource for a server-mode grid over a list that
 * **changes without change events** - an append-only log such as the audit
 * log, which grows on every login/denial and shrinks through retention
 * pruning, with no `invalidate()` to re-fetch on. Same block model as
 * `WindowedListResource` (windowed.svelte.ts), plus a per-generation
 * **snapshot boundary**.
 *
 * Why a separate class instead of an option on `WindowedListResource`
 * (Issue #248 design decision, recorded in CHANGELOG / spec §4.1):
 *
 * - The data source is an **injected fetcher**, not `getDataProvider()`:
 *   carrying the boundary through `DataProvider.getList` would change the
 *   provider contract every provider (InMemory/Tauri/HTTP) implements, while
 *   the lists that need a boundary are few and have dedicated APIs.
 * - The request pattern differs: until a generation has its boundary, only
 *   **one** block may be in flight (parallel first requests would each pick
 *   their own boundary, i.e. read different sets), and a changed count
 *   **stops** the generation instead of being absorbed. Folding that into
 *   the class every CRUD grid uses would change its behaviour (and its
 *   #212/#243 guarantees) for lists that do not need it.
 *
 * ### Generations and the snapshot boundary
 *
 * A generation starts at construction, `setParams()` (a new query) and
 * `refresh()` (the same query, re-read). Its **first answer fixes the
 * boundary** (`asOfId`, the largest id the server included) and the total
 * count; every later block of the generation sends that boundary, so the
 * server reads every block from the same set and rows **added** between two
 * block requests cannot shift `OFFSET` (no duplicate or gap at a block
 * edge). New rows appear on the next generation (`refresh()`).
 *
 * The boundary relies on the server's contract: ids grow monotonically and
 * are never reused, rows are not updated in ways that move them in the
 * order, and `totalCount` is counted inside the boundary.
 *
 * ### Changes inside the boundary expire the generation
 *
 * A boundary cannot keep the set fixed on its own: **deleted** rows
 * (retention pruning) leave it, and on a server that commits writes
 * concurrently (PostgreSQL) a row with a lower id can **commit late** and
 * enter it. Either shifts `OFFSET`. So an answer that differs from the
 * generation's first in `totalCount` **or** in `deletionEpoch` (optional: a
 * value the server advances, atomically with the deletion, whenever rows
 * are deleted) is not written: the block records an expiry, `expired`
 * becomes `true` and **the generation fetches nothing more** (every further
 * block would shift the same way). The count alone is not enough: a late
 * commit and a deletion of the same size keep it unchanged while the set
 * changed (Issue #248 review) - the epoch catches that. A server that
 * deletes rows while other writes can commit late must send
 * `deletionEpoch`; one that writes one at a time (SQLite) can rely on the
 * count, since without late commits every change moves it. It is not restarted automatically - with the row cap
 * reached and entries still arriving, an automatic restart would never
 * finish reading. `refresh()` starts a new generation. An answer with a
 * different `asOfId` than the one sent (a server that ignored the boundary)
 * is recorded as an error, not written.
 *
 * ### Failures and recovery
 *
 * - **A failure belongs to its block** and stays in `failures` (one entry
 *   per block, ascending) until that block loads or `setParams()` starts a
 *   new query. Another block's success does not clear it.
 * - **No silent retry**: a block that failed in the current generation is
 *   not requested again in that generation, even when a range covers it,
 *   and a failed first read does not move on to the next block (that would
 *   be the same read again). `refresh()` retries every block whose failure
 *   is still shown.
 * - **Recovery never depends on the visible range**: while a generation has
 *   no boundary yet, block 0 is requested even for an empty range (the grid
 *   reports `{0, 0}` whenever the count is 0 or unknown), so `refresh()` and
 *   `setParams()` always reach the server - after a failed first fetch and
 *   after a 0-row result alike.
 * - **A request cannot hang forever**: each block request fails after
 *   `requestTimeoutMs` and its `AbortSignal` is aborted. A new generation
 *   (and `dispose()`) aborts every request still in flight, so `loading`
 *   comes down at once and `refresh()` is never blocked by a hung request.
 * - **Answers from another generation are ignored**, and so is a late
 *   answer after a timeout.
 * - A fetcher that throws synchronously, rejects with anything, or answers
 *   with a malformed result (not an array, a count that is not a valid
 *   array length, rows beyond the array-length limit, an `asOfId` that is
 *   not a safe integer) records a failure for that block instead of
 *   throwing out of the resource.
 *
 * ### What a failure says (Issue #342)
 *
 * Every `'error'` failure carries a **code** (`SnapshotListFailureCode`), so
 * an app tells the kinds apart without comparing messages:
 *
 * - `'request'`: the fetcher threw or rejected. A thrown `ProviderError`
 *   (including an app's own subclass carrying more data) is kept **as the
 *   same object**; anything else is wrapped in a `SnapshotListError` whose
 *   message is `String(thrown)` and whose `cause` is the thrown value.
 * - `'timeout'`, `'boundaryMismatch'`, `'malformed'`: detected by the
 *   resource itself and recorded as a `SnapshotListError` with that code.
 *   Their messages come from the `messages` option (i18n layer 1: the
 *   app's resolved strings, docs/conventions.md §13), the English defaults
 *   otherwise. A message function that throws falls back to the default.
 *
 * A `SnapshotListError` thrown by the fetcher keeps its own code, so
 * `failure.code === failure.error.code` whenever `error` is one.
 *
 * Each `'error'` failure is also reported through the registered notifier
 * (a toast) unless the `notify` option turns that off or its predicate
 * declines the failure; an expiry is never notified (the page shows it).
 *
 * ### States the page can tell apart
 *
 * `totalCount` is `null` until the current query has been read once, so a
 * page can show "not read yet" (`null`, no failure), "could not read"
 * (`null`, `failures` non-empty) and "read, 0 rows" (`0`) separately.
 *
 * Runes constraint: like `WindowedListResource`, this class never creates an
 * `$effect`; the owning component calls `ensureRange()` / `dispose()`.
 * Internal decisions read private (non-reactive) copies of the params, so
 * calling `ensureRange()` inside an effect does not make that effect depend
 * on them.
