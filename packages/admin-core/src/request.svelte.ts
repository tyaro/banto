/**
 * `createRequestOwner` (spec §3 headless composables; shared-primitives-upstream-plan
 * §3.1・§4.1・D1, Issue #436): discard stale async results and release
 * temporary resources exactly once.
 *
 * One owner belongs to one screen / controller and is `dispose()`d on unmount.
 * Each `begin(key)` starts a request; it becomes **stale** when
 *
 * - a newer `begin(key)` supersedes it (same key only — keys are independent),
 * - the consumer calls `invalidate(key)` because the target changed (the
 *   consumer decides which changes matter: e.g. a crop or selection change
 *   invalidates an image request, an unrelated position change does not), or
 * - the owner is disposed.
 *
 * Two different things happen on staleness, and consumers need both:
 *
 * - **cancel**: `handle.signal` is aborted. Pass it to work that can stop
 *   (`fetch`, a provider that honours `AbortSignal`).
 * - **discard**: `handle.isCurrent()` turns false. Work that cannot be aborted
 *   (`createImageBitmap`, a clipboard write, a provider without a signal) runs
 *   to the end; the consumer checks `isCurrent()` right before applying the
 *   result and drops it otherwise. A stale request must not write the model,
 *   history, busy flag or error display.
 *
 * Side effects that already left the page cannot be rolled back: a completed
 * OS clipboard write stays written. What staleness promises there is only
 * that the consumer does not act on the stale result (e.g. does not delete
 * the old cut source). `begin()` is synchronous, so a request that needs
 * browser user activation can be started inside the gesture handler without
 * consuming the activation.
 *
 * Temporary resources (object URLs, decoded bitmaps, scratch stores) are
 * `hold()`-ed on the handle. Each one is released exactly once, at the
 * earliest of `finish()` and `owner.dispose()`, on every path (success,
 * failure, staleness) — unless the consumer `adopt()`s it, which transfers it
 * to the owner's model (and makes releasing it the model's job). Superseding /
 * `invalidate()` do not release early, because the stale work may still be
 * using the resource; `dispose()` does (the screen is gone).
 *
 * The contract is the case table in `tests/contracts/request-owner.json`.
 * Packages that cannot import admin-core (forms, §2.1 of the plan) keep an
 * internal implementation of the same contract and run the same table.
 *
 * Not a replacement for the session controller's credential revision
 * (session-controller-design): authentication keeps its own check.
